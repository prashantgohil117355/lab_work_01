# Simple Python Program: Age in 10 Years

# Ask for user's name
name = input("What is your name? ")

# Ask for user's age
age = int(input("How old are you? "))

# Calculate future age
future_age = age + 10

# Display the result
print(f"Hello, {name}! In 10 years, you will be {future_age} years old.")
